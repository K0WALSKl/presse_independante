# Presse Independant's Client

This client make requests to [an API](https://github.com/K0WALSKl/PresseIndependanteAPI) and displays the article 
from various independant sources.

## Compatibility

The client can be used on the web or in Android. It should works on IOS but I've never tried it since I don't have the
equipment to test it.
